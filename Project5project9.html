    <h2>About the Project</h2>
    <p>
        In this project, I refactored my turtle drawing code from Project 4. The goal was to simplify the structure by using functions, reduce repetition, and build a modular drawing system. By using loops and defining separate shapes as functions, I made the design both more readable and more efficient. Whereas project 4 required invidual functions for each shape, in this project I created groups of draw functions for example "draw_house" or "draw_sun", allowing for easy use.

    <h2>Sample Code</h2>
    <p>
        The code below uses the turtle library in Python to draw the entire house. By defining each portion of the house ("<code>draw_rectangle</code>" as the body for example), the function "<code>draw_house</code>" was defined, allowing me to use it simply. "t" is the turtle object for drawing, and x and y are the starting postions for the rectangle (house body), triangle (house roof), rectangle (house door), square (windows 1 and 2) and circle (door knob). <code>fill_color</code> defines the color that the rectangle will be filled with, in this case I used red for the body, brown for the roof, yellow for the door, light blue for the windows and black for the door knob. 
    <pre><code>

    def draw_house (t,x,y): 
    
        jump_to(t,x,y) # House Body
        draw_rectangle(t, 150, 100, fill_color="red")

        jump_to(t,x,y +1) # House Roof
        draw_triangle(t, 150, fill_color="brown")

        jump_to(t,x+55,y-40) # House Door
        draw_rectangle(t, 40, 60, fill_color="yellow")

        jump_to(t,x+15,y-40) # Window 1
        draw_square(t,25,fill_color="lightblue")

        jump_to(t,x+105,y-40) # Window 2
        draw_square(t,25,fill_color="lightblue")

        jump_to(t,x+62,y-70) # Door Knob
        draw_circle(t, 2, fill_color="black")

 # Done

    <h2>Final Scene</h2>
    <p>
        The final scene utilizes my refactored functions <code>draw_house</code>,<code>draw_sun</code>,<code>draw_cloud</code> and <code>draw_cloud_multiple</code> to create a scene with 5 houses, 2 suns, and multiple clouds.
