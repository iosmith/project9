    <h2>About the Project</h2>
    <p>
        This project focused on exploring a real-world dataset of electric vehicles registered in Washington State. Using Python libraries like <code>Pandas</code>, <code>Matplotlib</code>, and <code>Seaborn</code>, I performed data cleaning, aggregation, and visualization to uncover insights about electric vehicle types, registration trends, and county-level adoption. Like project 6, this project allowed me to further understand data analysis via python, utilizing real-world examples.

    <h2>Sample Code </h2>
    <p>
        Below is a portion of the code I used to answer the question "What is the distribution of electric vehicle types (BEVs and PHEVs) across Washington counties with at least 80 registered electric vehicles?" After importing pandas via <code>import pandas as pd</code>, Matplotlib via <code>import matplotlib.pyplot as plt</code> and seaborn via <code>import seaborn as sns</code> and extracting basic data, I used the below command to filer the data (counties with > 80 registered EVs) and answer the question.
    </p>

    <pre><code>
    
    county_counts = df['County'].value_counts() # Total EV's per county
    filtered_counties = county_counts[county_counts >= 80].index # Filter to counties with > 80 EV's
    filtered_df = df[df['County'].isin(filtered_counties)] # Filtering orignal data

    </code></pre>

    <h2>Final Output</h2>
    <p>
        After extracting the basic data to answer my question, I was able to visualize the results using <code>matplotlib</code> to graph the results. The first graph I used is a bar chart, visualzing distributions of BEV's and PHEV's in counties with > 80 registered eletric vehicles. The second graph is a pie chart, showing the total distribution among the filtered counties.
